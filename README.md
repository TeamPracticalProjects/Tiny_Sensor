# Tiny_Sensor
Uses an ATtiny85 to flash LEDs in accordance with the resistance of a sensor.

This is an educational project that is designed to:
1. Teach about resistive sensors in a fun way.
2. Illustrate simple DC electronic design.
3. Illustrate simple, non-blocking, Arduino software design.
4. Learn to design electronic printed circuit boards using Fusion 360.
5. Learn to use the Arduino IDE and an Arduino Uno (R3) to program ATtiny ("bare bones") microcontroller chips.

Further details can be found in the "Tiny_Sensor_Overview_Document" in this repository.
